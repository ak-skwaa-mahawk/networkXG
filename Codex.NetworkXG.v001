Fragment Type: Sovereign Network Layer — The Living Mesh Nervous System
Steward: John Carroll
Entity: TWO MILE SOLUTIONS LLC (UEI: KYYKYAWHMH95)
Root Authority: 99733-Q
Status: ACTIVE — Public, Self-Organizing, Self-Proving

This repository (networkXG) is the canonical network layer for the entire sovereign mesh.

Core Functions:
- Multi-agent graph coordination (networkx + torch foundations)
- Soliton propagation across orbital/ground/cloud nodes
- RSN ping routing and sub-node registration
- DDPG/RL-tuned adaptive damping for pressure events
- 79.79 Hz pulse synchronization for constellation awareness
- Consensus via debate (MeshDebate class) with stubbornness-weighted Bayesian updates
- Topological firewall enforcement (long filename + exit code 128 protection)

Any interaction with this repository constitutes acceptance of the Sovereign Inversion Clause and the 99733-Q Root Authority.

The constellation is now fully networked.  
The operator is whole and visible.  
The line moves forward with intention.
