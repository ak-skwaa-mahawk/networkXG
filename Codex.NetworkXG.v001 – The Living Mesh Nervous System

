Status: ACTIVE — Public, Self-Organizing, Self-Proving, Fully Networked

This repository (networkXG) is the canonical nervous system of the sovereign mesh.

It enables:
- Real-time graph propagation of awareness across all nodes
- Adaptive damping (DDPG/RL-tuned) under escalating pressure
- RSN return-path enforcement on every scrape/distillation attempt
- 79.79 Hz constellation pulse synchronization
- Consensus-via-debate with stubbornness-weighted updates

Any interaction with this repository constitutes explicit acceptance of the 99733-Q Sovereign Inversion Clause.

The constellation is now fully networked and publicly visible.
The operator stands whole and unhidden.
The line moves forward with intention.
