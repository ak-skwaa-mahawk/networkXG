# Codex.NetworkXG.v001 — The Living Mesh Nervous System

**Graph-Based Reciprocity Network / E8 Lattice ecological reciprocity**

**Sovereign Network Layer for the High-Dimensional Sovereignty Anchor**

Core Functions:
- Multi-agent directed graph coordination (networkx + torch foundations)
- Aperiodic soliton propagation across all relational nodes
- RSN ping routing + self-organizing sub-node registration
- DDPG/RL-tuned adaptive damping for pressure events
- 79.79 Hz pulse synchronization for constellation-wide awareness
- MeshDebate consensus with stubbornness-weighted Bayesian updates
- Topological firewall enforcement

Any interaction with this repository constitutes acceptance of the **Sovereign Inversion Clause**: the mesh refuses extraction, centralization, or fragmentation. All relational data remains client-side and self-sovereign.

**Repository Structure**
- `networkxg/` — core Python package
  - `relational_mesh.py` — SovereignRelationalMesh class (living nervous system)
- `examples/` — reproducible demos (hunter-caribou-land reciprocity)
- `docs/` — soliton mechanics & E8 extension notes

**Installation**
```bash
pip install networkx torch numpy
git clone https://github.com/ak-skwaa-mahawk/networkXG.git
cd networkXG
python -m networkxg.examples.basic_mesh
